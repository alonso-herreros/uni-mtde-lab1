What have you used the object `StandardScaler` in the assignment for? When
applying the `.fit_transform()` method in the dataset `X`, what is the result?

## <!-- MARK: Eval23-24 sample Q12 -->
When fitting a linear regression model, how could you obtain the most relevant
features in the dataset?

## <!-- MARK: Eval23-24 sample Q13 -->
Which regression model has shown the best performance in the assignment? Why do
you think that this model works better than the others?

## <!-- MARK: Eval23-24 sample Q14 -->
It is shown below two scatter plots, which relate the actual (or correct) values
to be estimated and the predicted values obtained when using two different
regression models. On the left side, it is displayed the results obtained when
using a linear regression model, while on the right side, it is depicted the
results obtained when using a KernelRidge regressor.

Having a look at the two plots, which regression model would achieve a better
$R^2$ coefficient and why? Justify your answer.

## <!-- MARK: Eval23-24 sample Q15 -->
As it is known, any regression model in `sklearn` includes, among others, the
`.fit()`, `.predict()` and `.score()` methods.

For the **linear regression model**, indicate which subset has been used for
both `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods, and what each of these methods performes
or calculates with that subset.
